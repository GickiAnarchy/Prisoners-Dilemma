2 players per game. X amount of rounds.
   Players earn points by:
     ~If both players choose "agree", each player gets 3 points.
     ~If both choose "defect", each player gets one point.
     ~If they each choose different, the player that chose "defect" gets 5 points and the player that chose "agree" gets 0 points.
   The player with the most points wins.
